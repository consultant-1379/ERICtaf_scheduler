        TAF Scheduler is a web application that provides a convenient way to generate schedules that describe to
        <a href="http://taf.lmera.ericsson.se/taflanding/tedocs/latest/index.html" target="_blank">TAF Test Executor</a>
        how your tests should be run. For detailed information on schedules, please see
        <a href="http://taf.lmera.ericsson.se/taflanding/tedocs/latest/schedule.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        TAF Scheduler strives to as far as possible remove the necessity for manual creation of schedules. Schedules
        are complex XML documents and mistakes can be made. Such mistakes can be costly given the time that it takes to
        execute Maintrack CI loops and team KGB+N jobs. TAF Scheduler provides the user with features such as <b>automatic
        schedule validation, schedule versioning and a mechanism to enable users to send schedules for peer review</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also provided is access control to your schedules. Schedules belong to a team and the team(s) available to a user
        are derived from LDAP roles for Cloud access - see Section 7 of
        <a href="http://confluence-nam.lmera.ericsson.se/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=30905470">this document</a>
        for details on access to the SPP Cloud areas. Any user of TAF Scheduler may view any schedule, but he or she may
        only edit schedules that belong to his or her team.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the schedule creation, validation and review functionality outlined above, TAF Scheduler also provides
        functionality to <b>record the execution history of Maintrack schedules</b> in concert with
        <a href="http://taf.lmera.ericsson.se/taflanding/tedocs/latest/index.html" target="_blank">TAF Test Executor</a>.
        That is, each time that TAF Test Executor retrieves a schedule from TAF Scheduler and executes it, it reports
        back the Product ISO version, Testware ISO version that were used in the test run. This data is stored in the
        TAF Scheduler database enabling a <b>recreation of that test run at any point in the future</b>.
