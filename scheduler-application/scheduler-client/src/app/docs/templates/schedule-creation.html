        Here we are showing a schedule being edited, but the functionality for creating a schedule from scratch is the
        same. <b>Note that we are creating a Maintrack schedule here. In the image you can see select boxes for Product,
        Drop and Type. When creating a KGB+N schedule these select boxes won't be visible.</b> See

        <p>
            Here you will have the option of assigning the schedule you are creating or editing to one of the teams that
            you belong to. The team(s) available to a you are derived from LDAP roles for Cloud access. <b>If you are not
            assigned to the correct team please contact the scrum master of the team you wish to create a schedule for
            and have them grant you access to that team's cloud area</b>.

            The schedule XML is entered here. It may be done manually or by using the various controls on the page to
            automatically generate XML tags. For a detailed description on schedule XML format see

        <h3>4 - Add XML tags Controls</h3>
        <p>
            These are, from left to right:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-laptop"></i>
                    Add 'env-properties' tag - allows the user to specify a set of environment properties. JVM version
                    for instance. These tags may be placed in the 'schedule', 'item-group' or 'item' levels.
                    <br><br>
                    If used at the 'item-group' or 'item' levels the 'env-properties' tag <b>must be the last element</b>.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i>
                    Add 'properties' tag - these go inside 'env-properties' tags and should have attributes
                    'type' and 'key', Clicking inside this tag brings up a control to auto insert these attributes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-cubes"></i>
                    Add 'item-group' tag - allows the user add item group tags. Item groups are a set of items
                    (see below) that are grouped together. The 'item-group' tag may have a boolean 'parallel' attribute which
                    indicates that the items in the group should be executed in parallel. Clicking inside the 'item-group'
                    tag brings up a control to auto insert this attribute.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-cube"></i>
                    Add 'item' tag - allows the user to add an item to the schedule. An item corresponds to a testware
                    package and 1 or more of the suite XML files that it contains. May be used in the 'schedule' or
                    'item-group' levels. See sections 5, 6 and 7 for further details.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-user"></i>
                    Add 'manual-item' tag - allows the user to specify manual items in order for TE to produce a combined
                    Allure report with TE executed tests and TMS test Campaigns. May only be used in the 'schedule'
                    level.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>
                    Add 'test-campaigns' tag - allows the user to specify a list of 'test-campaign' tags (see below).
                    Can only be placed within a 'manual-item' tag.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>
                    Add 'test-campaign' tag - allows the user to specify a TMS test campaign. This tag must have an 'id'
                    attribute which is id of TMS test campaign. Clicking inside the tag reveals a control that allows
                    auto insertion of this attribute.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-comment-o"></i>
                    Add comment tag - allows the user to leave comments in the XML.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i>
                    Add 'include' tag - allows the user to include another approved schedule to the XML.
                    May be used in the 'schedule' or 'item-group' levels. See the 'Including a Schedule' section below.

        <h3>5 - Testware List</h3>
        <p>
            The testware list consists of a list of testware packages. When in Maintrack mode, you will be creating a
            schedule for a particular drop. As such the testware in the list are the packages for the <b>latest testware
            ISO for the drop</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When in KGB+N mode the list of packages is the <b>very latest testware</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding Testware to the Schedule</h3>
        <p>
            To add testware to the schedule, select the testware in the list. The testware will be highlighted in blue
            and a <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> icon will be displayed on the left of the package:
        </p>
        <img ng-src="{{vm.selectedTestware}}" class="scheduleDocs-image">
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Click the <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> icon to open the suite selection popup:
        </p>
        <img ng-src="{{vm.suitesPopup}}" class="scheduleDocs-image">
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Select the suites that you want to use and then click OK. The testware will appear as an item in the XML.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>6 - Testware Highlighting</h3>
        <p>
            Notice that certain testware packages are highlighted in green. This indicates that the packages in question
            are included in the XML. For example, <b>ERICTAFipsmtemplatemanagerservice_CXP9031851</b> is the first testware
            item in the item group in this example. This is useful for seeing what packages you have already used at a glance.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>7 - Testware Suites Warning Icon</h3>
        <p>
            Many, if not most testware packages include several suite XML files which specify what test cases should be
            run, in what order and whether execution should be in parallel or sequentially. The warning icon displayed on
            a package in the testware list means that not all of the suite XML files for that particular package are
            present in the XML. <b>ERICTAFidenmgmtopendj_CXP9030850</b> has 2 suite XML files included, <b>OpenDJ.xml</b>
            and <b>OpenDJ_FunctionalTest.xml</b>. This warning indicator tells us that more are available.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>8 - Refresh Testware Control</h3>
        <p>
            Clicking this icon refreshes the testware in the list. In Maintrack mode, if a new testware ISO for the drop
            is discovered, the packages in that ISO will be displayed.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>9 - Validate / Save Control</h3>
        <p>
            Schedules are validated against a schema to ensure that the XML is correctly formed. Other validation includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that items in the XML are in the testware list</li>
                <li>Ensuring that the specified suite XML files exist in the testware</li>
                <li>Ensuring that the an included schedule actually exists and is approved</li>
                <li>Ensuring that any test campaign ids specified actually exist in TMS</li>
            </ul>
            Validation can be performed as a standalone step, but it is automatically performed when the 'Save' button
            is pressed. If validation fails, the offending areas of the XML are highlighted in red and an error icon
            appears at the top of the editor. Clicking this icon reveals a popup that shows information about each error.
            The image below shows well formed XML with 4 errors:
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>A package doesn't exist in the testware list</li>
                <li>A suite XML file doesn't exist in the testware</li>
                <li>A test campaign with the specified id doesn't exist in TMS</li>
                <li>An included schedule doesn't exist</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Validation may be overridden - that is you may proceed to save the schedule even if it fails validation.
            Only choose this course of action if you are certain about the outcome</b>.
            <br><br>
            After saving a schedule, you will be presented with the option to
            <a ui-sref="documentation.schedule-review">send it for review</a>.

        <h2>Including a schedule</h2>
        <p>
            Including a schedule is essentially embedding a schedule within the one you are currently creating or
            editing.
            <a href="http://taf.lmera.ericsson.se/taflanding/tedocs/latest/index.html" target="_blank">TAF Test Executor</a>
            can retrieve an included schedule from TAF Scheduler and execute it as part of the schedule that it is
            included in. To include a schedule, click the <i class="fa fa-plus-square-o"></i> icon from the control
            group (See section 4). A popup will be displayed that allows you to select schedules by drop. <b>Note that
            only approved schedules will be displayed</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select the schedule(s) that you want to include and press OK. The include tags will be added to the XML.
            Included schedule XML is displayed in a read only editor below the main editor as shown in the image below:
        </p>
        <img ng-src="{{vm.scheduleEditInclude}}" class="scheduleDocs-image">
        <br><br>
        <h3>Validation of Included Schedules</h3>
        <p>
            Included schedules undergo the same validation process as the 'parent' schedule that it is included in.
            Any validation errors will be highlighted in red in the <b>included schedule's</b> editor and a description
            of the errors will be shown in the popup above the main editor as described in section 9. If there are validation
            errors for both the main schedule and the included schedule, the errors in the popup will be prefixed with
            the respective schedule name to enable easy identification.
