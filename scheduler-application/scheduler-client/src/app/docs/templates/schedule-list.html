    <div>
        <h3>1 - Product and Drop Filter</h3>
        <p>
            Maintrack schedules are created on a per drop basis. Select a product and drop combination to see the
            schedules that have been created for that particular drop.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2 - Team Filter</h3>
        <p>
            Schedules belong to teams and the team a schedule belongs to is determined when it is created. The teams(s)
            you belong to are derived from LDAP roles that grant access to the various cloud areas. <b>If you find that you
            do not have the appropriate rights to edit or review a schedule you should contact the scrum master of the
            team in question and request that you be granted access rights to their cloud area</b>. See section 7 of
            <a href="http://confluence-nam.lmera.ericsson.se/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=30905470" target="_blank">this page</a>
            for details.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>3 - KGB+N Tab</h3>
        <p>
            Switch to the KGB+N tab to see a list of KGB+N schedules. KGB+N schedules are not tied to any particular
            drop so you'll see that the option to select a product and drop isn't available. KGB+N schedules can be
            filtered by team as before.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>4 - Table Highlighting</h3>
        <p>
            A table row is highlighted in green <b>if and ony if</b> it is <b>approved</b>. Schedules
            are not discoverable and therefore not executable by
            <a href="http://taf.lmera.ericsson.se/taflanding/tedocs/latest/index.html" target="_blank">TAF Test Executor</a>
            if they are not approved. Schedule approval is done through the review process - more on this in the
            <a ui-sref="documentation.schedule-review">Review a Schedule</a> section.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>5 - Action Block</h3>
        <p>
            The action icons allow you to view, edit or delete a schedule. Note that you only have write access to the
            schedule if you are in the team that owns the schedule. If you're not, the edit and delete icons for that
            schedule won't be visible. This can be seen on the 4th row of the table, where the currently logged in user
            has read only access for 'MTE.xml'.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>6 - Add schedule icon</h3>
        <p>
            Clicking this icon allows you to create a new schedule. Bear in mind that if the 'Maintrack' tab is active
            you will be directed to a page where you can create a schedule for the currently selected drop.
        </p>
        <p>
            If however the 'KGB+N' tab is selected you will be directed to a page where you create a KGB+N schedule
            which is not tied to any drop. See detailed information on schedule creation and editing
            <a ui-sref="documentation.schedule-create">here</a>
